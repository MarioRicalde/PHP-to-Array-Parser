# About
A simple PHP Parser that will convert Valid PHP Code into a big array. Here you can see the output [PARSED CODE](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4651065/pa.html).

This code was part of the PHP Smart Autocompletion bundle which I was working on but couldn't complete.

# WARNING
This code is not meant to be used without LOTS OF REFACTORING. I was planning on doing it but because of work I had to leave the PHP Scene, to join the Ruby Force.

So if you ever complete this parser (or if I ever found the time to do it), I'll be pleased to convert it into a Textmate Autocompletion Bundle.
